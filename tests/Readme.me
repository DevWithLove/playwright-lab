Playwright Test is based on the concept of test fixtures. 
Test fixtures are used to establish the environment for each test, 
giving the test everything it needs and nothing else. 
Test fixtures are isolated between tests. With fixtures, you can group tests based on their meaning, 
instead of their common setup.
